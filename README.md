# Description
Salvage N' Sustain acts as a posting board for eco-friendly initiatives and events (ex. Toy drives, store collection of used-clothes). It also provides recycling/disposal guides to provide proper instruction on how to get rid of a certain item.

# Purpose
The goal of the website is to eliminate unecessary waste, ultimately encouraging reusing, recyling, and offering resources to those who need it, instead of immediately disposing used items.
